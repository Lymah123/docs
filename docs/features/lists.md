The OpenSauced Lists feature enables you to categorize, monitor, and analyze different groups of contributors within open source projects. With the Lists feature, gain granular insights into each contributor's activity and contributions.

Monitor individual commit histories, track who is actively engaged, identify alumni or new contributors, and even compare the performance of contributors against each other. This encompasses a wide range of metrics such as code commits, created and reviewed Pull Requests (PRs), as well as issue creation and commenting.

Contributors can use Lists feature to track their own activity, while maintainers can use the feature to manage the community.

## Lists for Maintainers

Lists offer a variety of opportunities to track contributors for various reasons, including:

- **Interacting contributors**: Keep tabs on contributors actively interacting with your repository.

- **Organization's developers**: Monitor the contributions and performance of your internal team.

- **VIP contributors**: Highlight and track at least five developers who are key maintainers or significant contributors.

- **Your GitHub Teams**: Track the activity of your teams to identify if contributors are still active. For example, if you have members on your triage team, you can see their activity level on your repositories to determine if they're still active enough to participate in that role.

- **Potential hires**: Observe contributors who exhibit skill and commitment, making them prime candidates for hiring.

- **Alumni contributors**: Keep an eye on contributors who have decreased their engagement or left the project.

## Lists for Contributors

Lists offer contributors a way to gain insight into the world of open source contributions, including:

- **Track personal contributions**: If you create a list of your personal contributions, you can track them and see how you're doing over time, as well as get a breakdown of the type of contributions you're making, including commits, created PRs, reviewed PRs, and created issues.

- **Learn about what other contributors are doing in open source**: You can learn where other contributors are contributing, what they're working on, and how active they are in the open source community.

- **See who's using OpenSauced Highlights feature**: You can see who's using the Highlights feature and show them support by giving an emoji reaction.

- **Track contributors for job opportunities**: If you're looking for a job, you can track the activity of the contributors you're interested in working with. This helps you understand the activity level of the repositories and the types of contributions being made, and you can even identify which company you want to contribute to.

There are three ways to add a list:

1. **Explore Contributors**: Use our explore tool to find contributors and create your list.
2. **Sync your GitHub Team**: Connect to your GitHub to create a list from a team in your organization.
3. **Import your GitHub Following**:
   Connect to your GitHub to create a list with all the contributors you follow.

Once your list is created, you'll be able to see an overview of all the contributors in your list, a graph of their activity, and a detailed breakdown of the contributors.

## Using Your List

Once you have created your list, you will be redirected to your List Page. Here, you will see a dashboard with an overview of the contributions in your list.

There are three tabs that provide you with more information on these repositories:

## Overview

The Overview tab gives you a high-level view of the contributors in your list, including the total number of commits in the last 30 days and the types of contributors on your list: Active, New, and Alumni.

## Activity

The Activity tab gives you a graph view with more detailed information on each contributor, including the type of activity, repositories they've contributed to, and how they compare to each other.

There's also the Highlights tab that shows any Highlights on OpenSauced that have been made by the contributors on the list.

## Highlight Your Open Source Contributions

The Highlights feature is the place you can display your favorite open source contributions, share the story, and inspire others to join you in your open source journey. For maintainers, it's a great way to showcase your project and the issues that need support and attract new contributors.

There are currently three types of highlights you can add to your profile:

- Dev.to blog post.
- Pull request.
- Issue.

## How to Add a Highlight

- Go to [OpenSauced's Highlights feed](https://app.opensauced.pizza/feed).
- Click the "Post a highlight to show your work!" input.
- Paste the URL to your blog post, pull request, or issue in the bottom input.
- Either use our Auto-Summarize feature or write your own summary.
